# PyMark Watermarking Frontend

PyMark Watermarking is a web-based application developed to streamline the watermarking process and facilitate automated publishing of watermarked images on Instagram. This project comprises two main features: **File-Sharing** and **Instagram-Publisher**.

## Key Features

### 1. File-Sharing

This feature uses Google Drive as a storage platform for watermarked images and includes the following sub-features:

-   **Embedding**: Embeds a watermark image into a host image, producing a watermarked image (BMP), watermark position image (BMP), key matrix (NPY), and a compressed public image (JPG). The system also provides imperceptibility analysis using Peak Signal to Noise Ration and Structural similarity Index Measurement metrics.
-   **Extraction**: Extracts the watermark from a watermarked image using the watermark position image (BMP), key matrix (NPY), and optionally conducts robustness analysis using Bit Error Rate and Normalized Cross Correlation metrics.
-   **Image Processing**: Provides various image manipulation options such as blurring, Gaussian noise, sharpening, cropping, scaling, and more.
-   **Analysis**: Performs imperceptibility analysis using Peak Signal to Noise Ration and Structural similarity Index Measurement, as well as robustness evaluation with Bit Error Rate and Normalized Cross Correlation.
-   **My Drive**: Displays watermarked folders stored in Google Drive without requiring users to open the Google Drive application.

### 2. Instagram-Publisher

This feature integrates with the Meta Graph API to allow users to upload watermarked images directly to Instagram.

-   **Post Now**: Embeds a watermark into a host image and publishes it on Instagram with a caption, mentions, and hashtags. The embedding result is stored on Google Drive.
-   **My Post**: Displays watermarked image folders generated by the "Post Now" feature and stored in Google Drive.

## Technologies

### Frontend Framework and Integration

The PyMark frontend is developed using **Nuxt.js**, a Vue.js-based framework that enables the creation of dynamic, SEO-friendly, and responsive web applications. Nuxt.js supports reusable component structures, streamlining UI development and maintenance.

For backend integration, the frontend utilizes Nuxt.jsâ€™s `$fetch` function to securely communicate with the `pymark-backend`, facilitating essential operations such as user authentication, file upload, watermark embedding, and Instagram publishing via API endpoints.

### Authentication

Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access application features:

-   **File-Sharing**: JWT tokens are stored in cookies for secure access.
-   **Instagram-Publisher**: Authentication is handled through **Facebook Login**, which generates an access token using the Facebook SDK.

## Getting Started

### Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn preview
```
